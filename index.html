    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>I'm hosted with Github Pages.</p>
    <p>
      Today is November 1, 2020. I have decided to resume learning Python again
      and posting on my GitHub page every day! I hope to keep this up for at
      least the next one year from today.

      Learning Python is fun. Therefore, I hope to have completed going through
      the text within one (1) month. That is, I hope to be done with the
      preliminary stages of learning Python by the end of the month of November
      2020. Wish me success!
