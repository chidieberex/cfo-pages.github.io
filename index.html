    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>I'm hosted with Github Pages.</p>
    <p>
      Today is November 1, 2020. I have decided to resume learning Python again
      and posting on my GitHub page every day! I hope to keep this up for at
      least the next one year from today.

      Learning Python is fun. Therefore, I hope to have completed going through
      the text within one (1) month. That is, I hope to be done with the
      preliminary stages of learning Python by the end of the month of November
      2020. Wish me success!
    </p>

      Today is November 2, 2020. I could not work on any Python coding lessons.
      I did however work on some R programming for my Data Scientist ambition. I
      watched a couple of YouTube videos on R programming for Data Scientists. I
      hope to do some more of that tomorrow. I will try to continue to update my
      programming journey on this space.
